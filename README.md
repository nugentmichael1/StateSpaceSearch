# StateSpaceSearch
CSCI164 Project - 8 &amp; 15 Puzzles
Spring 2022

### Provided Instructions
In this assignment you will explore State-Space Search with the 8-Puzzle and 15-Puzzle.  You will need to implement and provide code for the following algorithms:

-Breadth-First Search    
-Depth-First Search    
-Iterative-Deepening Depth-First Search    
-A* w/ Out-Of-Place, and Manhattan Distance Heuristics
-Iterative Deepening A* w/ Out-Of-Place, and Manhattan Distance Heuristics    

Develop search code with requirements:

-Input puzzle as a two strings, initial state and goal state.    
-Produce the solution as a string of "udlr" representing the move "up", "down", "left", and "right" for the movement of the blank.    
-Produce the number of expanded nodes required to find solution.    

In addition, develop code to test a solution with requirements:

    Input initial puzzle state as string.
    Input move sequence as string.
    Produce output state from applying move sequence to initial state.

Provide link to Github repository with all code, and submit final report as PDF with requirements:

    Provide overview of your code.
